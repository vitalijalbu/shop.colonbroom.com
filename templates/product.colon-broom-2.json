For most people, unless you alter your diet and get daily exercise, no supplement is going to have a big impact.<br\/><br\/>Getting at least 7-8 hours of sleep, eating a healthy balanced diet, consuming at least 1.5 L of water per day, and getting at least 150 min of moderate physical activity per week can greatly improve your gut health and weight loss.
